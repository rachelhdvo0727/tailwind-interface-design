          William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 - 23 April 1616) was an
          English playwright, poet, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest
          writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He
          is often called England's national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or
          simply "the Bard"). His extant works, including collaborations,
          consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a
          few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been
          translated into every major living language and are performed more
          often than those of any other playwright. They also continue to be
          studied and reinterpreted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire.
          At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three
          children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585
          and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer,
          and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men,
          later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to
          have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few
          records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated
          considerable speculation about such matters as his physical
          appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the
          works attributed to him were written by others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613.
          His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded
          as some of the best work produced in these genres. He then wrote
          mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet,
          Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest
          works in the English language. In the last phase of his life, he wrote
          tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other
          playwrights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of Shakespeare's plays were published in editions of varying
          quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow
          actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell,
          published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a
          posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that
          included all but two of his plays. The volume was prefaced with a poem
          by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hailed Shakespeare in a
          now-famous quote as "not of an age, but for all time".

            To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow, <br />
            Creeps in this petty pace from day to day <br />
            To the last syllable of recorded time, <br />
            And all our yesterdays have lighted fools <br />
            The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle! <br />
            Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player <br />
            That struts and frets his hour upon the stage <br />
            And then is heard no more: it is a tale <br />
            Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, <br />
            Signifying nothing.<br /><br />
